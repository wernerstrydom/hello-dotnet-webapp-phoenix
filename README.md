# Hello Phoenix

This repository contains a simple web application, written in .NET, that 
displays "Hello Phoenix". The GitHub Actions workflow in this repository
builds the application and deploys it to Azure App Service, demonstrating 
how to create a temporal environment for each build in order to run tests,
before then deploying to a "production" environment.
